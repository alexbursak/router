- implement caching system for better performance
- refactor parseRoutes in RoutesParser
- change routes config file structure (make more readable)
- introduce value objects instead of primitives
- remove interfaces. (useless, I am not using them anyway)
- refactor and/or add more good unit tests. Some tests are useless. (not all cases covered)
- add more functional tests (more rotes cases, controllers etc.)
- prepare simple demo on heroku
- implement simple CI (github plugin?)
- refactor 'cleanUpUrl' method (see comments)
- refactor findRoute (see comments)
- go through phpdoc and refactor where it is needed
- implement "Router Interface" with intuitive "addRoute", "getRoutes" methods (for others)
- change index.php so it can accept arguments (url, file path) to improve functional testing
