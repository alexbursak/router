2 - refactor parseRoutes in RoutesParser

9 - implement simple CI (github plugin?)  
10 - refactor 'cleanUpUrl' method (see comments)  
11 - refactor findRoute (see comments)  
12 - go through phpdoc and refactor where it is needed  
13 - implement "Router Interface" with intuitive "addRoute", "getRoutes" methods (for others)  
14 - change index.php so it can accept arguments (url, file path) to improve functional testing  
15 - implement routes names for better routes management  
16 - introduce yaml driver for routes   
17 - introduce xml driver for routes (?)  

18 - refactor ArrayCollection class  

## DONE:
